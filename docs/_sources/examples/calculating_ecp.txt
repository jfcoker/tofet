    \begin{verbatim}
    getSeries.py converged_output.out occupied_molecules > occupiedMolecules.occ;
    tofetOccupation fet.sim scl_fet.edge scl_fet.xyz occupiedMolecules.occ > output.out;

    Set `\verb!converged 1!' in your \verb!*.sim! file and provide a list of occupied molecules from a previously converged simulation in a \verb!*.occ! file as an argument to \verb!tofetOccupation!.
    Also set \verb!printOccupation 1! and \verb!printEnergies 1! in your \verb!*.sim! file.
