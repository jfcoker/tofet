The input and output files of all the examples are in :file:`/trunk/examples/GSL_randomGenerator`.
If you don't see an example that relates to your problem, but suspect that ToFeT might be able to handle it, :doc:`email me </contact>`: you might be right!


.. warning:: 
    All examples provided are highly simplistic!
    When running your own simulations, you need to ensure that your morphology is sufficiently large, and your simulation sufficiently well converged.
