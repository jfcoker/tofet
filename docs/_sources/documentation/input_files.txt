Input files
=======================

.. toctree::
    
    xyz_file
    edge_file
    sim_file

ToFeT takes three input files:

:doc:`wonderful_morphology.xyz <xyz_file>`
    describing the placement of each molecule in the film.
:doc:`fast.edge <edge_file>`
    describing the interactions between neighbouring molecules.
:doc:`foo.sim <sim_file>`
    containing all the simulation parameters.

Your input files may have any prefix, but they must end in the correct suffix.
Each file contains a number of columns, each of which is delimited by any amount of blank space.
