Warnings and apologies
================================
ToFeT has been carefully tested, but it is probable that bugs remain.
Although I certainly hope these will be minor, I would appreciate any :doc:`feedback or comments </contact>`.

ToFeT grew somewhat organically, with features added as they were needed.
As a result, there are places where the code could be cleaner or faster.
If ToFeT is ever the bottleneck in your simulations, let me know: there are certainly algorithmic and design improvements that could help.

Finally, this documentation has been cobbled together at speed.
If anything is unclear, or if more details are required, please feel free to send me your questions.
