Calculating mobilities
============================

.. _sec_velocity_mu:

Mobilities from average velocity
---------------------------------
As each charge is collected, it's velocity in the direction of :attr:`fieldZ` is calculated.  The mobility is calculated from the average velocity.  Charges that aren't collected don't contribute to the mobility:

.. math::
    \mu = \frac{L}{F} \cdot \left< \frac{1}{t} \right>_{collected hoppers}

where *L* is the depth of the film along the Z-axis, *F* is the field and *t* is the time at which a hopper is collected.

This mobility is labelled as ``MOBILITY FROM COLLECTION TIMES`` in ToFeT's output.

.. _sec_convergence:

Convergence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ToFeT uses the :ref:`sec_velocity_mu` to determine when the simulation has converged (as defined by :attr:`tol`).
If :attr:`maxTime` isn't sufficiently large and some charges aren't being collected, or if the mobility isn't well converged from all :term:`runs <run>`, ToFeT will issue warnings.
Depending on these warnings, :attr:`maxTime` or :attr:`maxRuns` should be increased.
Alternatively, :attr:`tol` could also be increased.


.. _sec_displacement_mu:

Mobilities from average displacement
-------------------------------------
The aggregate distance moved by all charges along the field is used to calculate a velocity, and hence mobility.  All charges, even those that aren't collected, contribute to this value.

.. math::
    \mu = \frac{1}{T \cdot F} \left< \Delta Z \right>_{all hoppers}

where *Delta Z* is the total distance moved by a hopper along the Z-axis, and *T* is the total time of the simulation (aggregated over all runs).

This mobility is labelled as ``MOBILITY FROM TOTAL DISPLACEMENT AND TOTAL TIME`` in ToFeT's output.
