Random number generators
==========================

GSL
^^^

Compile with: ``make``

It is preferable to use the GSL random number generator `GSL <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_ because of the flexibility it affords.
By default, the generator always uses the same seed in the simulations; this means you'll always get the same result every time you run the simulation.
If you want unique simulations, you can modify the seed by setting the environment variable :envvar:`GSL_RNG_SEED`.
For example, in a Linux environment, you might type::

    GSL_RNG_SEED=$RANDOM  tft  foo.sim  bar.xyz  foobar.edge

By default, the generation algorithm is the MT19937 Mersenne Twister.
For details of how to change this and other settings, refer to the GSL documentation.

RandomB
^^^^^^^^

Compile with: ``make randomB``

ToFeT is packaged with its own random number generator (kindly supplied by Rosie Chandler) in case you haven't got the GSL installed.
However, full support hasn't yet been added for this generator.
In particular, if you want a random seed rather than the default, you'll need to edit the appropriate lines in :file:`trunk/source/RandomB.cc` and recompile.
