About ToFeT
===========

ToFeT is a numerical model of charge transport in molecular films, able to simulate the time-of-flight experiment (ToF) :term:`Kwiatkowski_2008_PCCP`, field-effect transistors (FeTs) :term:`Kwiatkowski_2009_NanoLetters`, and potentially dark-injection.  
As its input, ToFeT takes a description of the film at a molecular level: a description of the position of all molecules and the interactions between them.  
As its output, ToFeT produces electrical characteristics such as mobilities, JV curves, and photocurrent transients.  ToFeT thus allows the *microscopic* properties of a film to be related to its *macroscopic* electronic properties.


ToFeT currently assumes that charges hop between molecules with a rate described by semi-classical Marcus theory.  
In addition to a description of the morphology of the film, ToFeT also requires the transfer integrals between neighbouring molecules, some description of the energetics of charge transfer, and the reorganisation energy.

Further details of the methodologies used in ToFeT can be found in chapter 4 of reference :term:`Kwiatkowski_2008_thesis`.
