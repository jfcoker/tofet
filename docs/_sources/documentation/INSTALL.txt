Installation
=======================

Prerequisites
-----------------------

C++ compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The only requisite to run the core code (contained in :file:`/trunk/source`) is a C++ compiler.

GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, ToFeT uses the `GSL <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_ to generate random numbers. 
However, if you don't have this installed, an alternative generator is included in the package; see the section: :ref:`sec:rngs`.


Command-line interface, Python, and Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A lot of the functionality that ToFeT offers for the extraction and analysis of data is provided by Python scripts run from the command line.
A `Python <http://python.org>`_ installation of 2.5 or more recent is necessary.
For some scripts, including :mod:`tft_calc_ecp.py` and :mod:`tft_rotate_coords.py`, `SciPy and NumPy <http://scipy.org/>`_ are also necessary.


Building ToFeT
---------------
#. `Download <http://code.google.com/p/tofet/downloads/list>`_ a :file:`***.tar.gz` (or, if you're feeling bold, `check it <http://code.google.com/p/tofet/source/checkout>`_ out of the repository directly).
#. Unpack: ``tar -zxvf ToFeT_**.tar.gz``
#. Edit the Makefile (see comments within)
#. Cross your fingers
#. Type: ``make``

It is **highly recommended that you allow your compiler to make optimisations.**
ToFeT was developed using the GCC, version 4.3.
Any other compiler is likely to give warnings - please :doc:`let me know </contact>` of these and I'll make the necessary clean-ups.

If you don't have the GSL  installed type: ``make randomB`` instead of ``make``.

The Makefile generates two executables, :mod:`tft` and :mod:`tft_occ`.
The former is the most general, the latter is used only when you want to track the time that each molecule is occupied (see below).


Testing ToFeT
--------------
A test suite is provided for the GSL random number generator in :file:`trunk/examples/GSL\_randomGenerator/test`.
Make sure that :mod:`tft` and :mod:`tft_occ` are in your path, and run the tests by typing::

    python tofetTest.py
