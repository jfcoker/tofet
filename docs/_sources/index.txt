ToFeT is a numerical model of charge transport in molecular films, able to simulate the time-of-flight experiment (ToF) :term:`Kwiatkowski_2008_PCCP`, field-effect transistors (FeTs) :term:`Kwiatkowski_2009_NanoLetters`, and potentially dark-injection.  

As its input, ToFeT takes a description of the film at a molecular level: a description of the position of all molecules (the morphology) and the interactions between them (transfer integrals and energetics).  Currently, ToFeT simply assumes that the rate of intermolecular charge transfer is described by semi-classical Marcus theory.  

As its output, ToFeT produces electrical characteristics such as mobilities, JV curves, and photocurrent transients.  ToFeT thus allows the *microscopic* properties of a film to be related to its *macroscopic* electronic properties.

Further details of the methodologies used in ToFeT can be found in chapter 4 of reference :term:`Kwiatkowski_2008_thesis`.

Join the mailing list
=======================
Although ToFeT has been carefully developed, it is possible that minor bugs remain.  You are therefore advised to join the (exceptionally) low volume ToFeT mailing list by :doc:`contacting me </contact>`.

Work on ToFeT and its documentation continues; comments, questions, and suggestions are also very welcome.


From whence ToFeT came....
============================
ToFeT was initially developed in the group of Professor Jenny Nelson at Imperial College London, and is now maintained by :doc:`Joe Kwiatkowski </contact>` at Stanford University.
For a full history of ToFeT and a list of the contributing authors please see :doc:`CREDITS`.
For the license under which ToFeT is released, please see :doc:`COPYING` and :doc:`COPYING.LESSER`.
