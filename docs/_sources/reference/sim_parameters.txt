Simulation parameters
***********************

.. attribute:: alpha

    (:attr:`tof <mode>` or :attr:`regenerate <mode>` modes only).

    The geometric scaling of time bins.

    See also section :ref:`sec_time`.

.. attribute:: converged 

    (1,0) 
    (:attr:`fet <mode>` mode only).
    If 1, set the hopper density as converged immediately.
    Make sure to feed the simulation the correct distribution of hoppers in a occ file as an option to protect_me.

.. attribute:: cyclesForConverence 

    (1,0)
    (:attr:`fet <mode>` only).
    The current must be within :attr:`tol` for this many cycles for the current to be deemed converged.
    Defaults to 15.
    See also movesCycle

.. attribute:: dielectric

    (:attr:`regenerate <mode>` and :attr:`fet <mode>` modes only).  Whenever hopperInteractions are enabled (by default for :attr:`fet <mode>`), specify the dielectric constant.

.. attribute:: fieldZ

    The field along the z axis in qV/Ang, where q=$pm$1 for holes / electrons.
    protect_me always expects charges to drift along the z axis.
    In a normal setup the generators are at small z's and the collectors are at large z's.
    In this case fieldZ must be negative so that charges move in a positive direction along z.
    textbf{Note:} because q is contained within this definition of the field, no adjustment to fieldZ has to be made between hole and electron simulations: both drift along z for negative fieldZ's.

.. attribute:: deltaTime

    (:attr:`tof <mode>` or :attr:`regenerate <mode>` modes only).
    The width of the first time bin used to store transient current events (see section~ref{sec::attr:`tof <mode>`:configuring}).

    See also section :ref:`sec_time`.

.. attribute:: hoppers

    (:attr:`tof <mode>` or :attr:`regenerate <mode>` mode only).
    The number of hoppers (charges).

.. attribute:: hopperInteractions 

    (1, 0)
    Turns on carrier-carrier Coulombic interactions.
    Currently only enabled for the :attr:`fet <mode>` and :attr:`regenerate <mode>` modes.

.. attribute:: maxRuns

    (:attr:`tof <mode>` or :attr:`regenerate <mode>` modes only).
    The maximum number of runs.
    If the mobility hasn't converged within maxRuns, the simulation will be truncated.

.. attribute:: maxTime

    The maximum time of simulation (s).
    Simulations will be truncated at maxTime unless they have already converged.

    See also section :ref:`sec_time`.

.. attribute:: mode 

    (:attr:`tof <mode>`, :attr:`regenerate <mode>`, :attr:`fet <mode>`)
    By default protect_me simulates the time-of-flight experiment in which charges are removed from the simulation whenever they are collected.
    However, protect_me can also run in the :attr:`regenerate <mode>` mode where, every time a charge is collected, another is immediately :attr:`regenerate <mode>`d.
    protect_me can also simulate field-effect transistors in the :attr:`fet <mode>` mode.

.. attribute:: movesCycle 

    (:attr:`fet <mode>` mode only).
    Convergence is checked every movesCycle Monte Carlo steps.  Defaults to 2e4.
    See also cyclesForConvergence.

.. attribute:: printOccupation 

    (1, 0)
    If 1, print the occupation probabilities of each molecule (see section~ref{sec:use}).
    textbf{Note:} to get occupation probabilities you also need to use the binary protect_meOccupation.

.. attribute:: printVertices 
    
    (1,0)
    If 1, print the details of each molecule.

.. attribute:: printEdges
    
    (1,0)
    If 1, print the details of all intermolecular interactions.
    Warning, not fully tested.

.. attribute:: reorg
    
    The reorganisation energy (eV)

.. attribute:: siteEnergies

    (1,0)
    By default protect_me expects $Delta E$ in your edge file, unless you are in :attr:`fet <mode>` mode or have activated hopperInteractions.
    However, if you are providing site energies (E) in your .xyz file instead, you must specify siteEnergies 1 in your .sim file.
    Site energies must be provided for :attr:`fet <mode>` and for :attr:`regenerate <mode>` simulations when hopperInteractions are on.

.. attribute:: temp

    The temperature (K)

.. attribute:: tol

    Stop the simulation when the fractional change in the mobility~/~current is between ``1-tol`` and ``1+tol``.
    track (1,0)
    Track each hop of each hopper.
    Must be used in conjunction with the executable protect_meOccupation.

.. attribute:: Vds

    (:attr:`fet <mode>` mode only).
    The source-drain voltage (qV), where q=$pm$1 for holes / electrons.
    As for fieldZ, no adjustment has to be made to Vds to switch from simulating holes to simulating electrons since q is contained in the units; in both cases both drift along z for negative Vds.

.. attribute:: Vg

    (:attr:`fet <mode>` mode only).
    The gate voltage (qV), where q=$pm$1 for holes / electrons.
    As for Vds, no adjustment has to be made for holes / electrons; in both cases charges are drawn into the channel by positive Vg.

.. attribute:: verbosity 

    (high, low)
    By default the verbosity of the output is low; set to high if you want more runtime information.
