    1) tof:
    	Default. 
	'hoppers' number of charges are generated randomly on generators. 
	Charges are collected on collectors
    2) regenerate:
    	'hoppers' number of charges are generated randomly on generators
	When collected on collectors, another charge is generated on generator
    3) fet:
    	'hoppers' number of charges are generated randomly on generators
	'siteEnergies' must be provided
	Electrodes are set (i.e. energy of generators = 0, energy of collectors = _fieldZ * lengthZ)

siteEnergies
************
    1) Read in site energies of vertices (rather than site energy differences *between* vertices)
    2) ***.xyz file must be of the form:
    	---x---y---z---type---energy---
    3) ***.edge file must be of the form:
    	---mol1_ID---mol2_ID---J---

hoppers
*******
    1) number of hoppers to generate
